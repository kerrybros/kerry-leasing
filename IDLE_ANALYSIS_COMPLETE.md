### **To Enable Full Interactive Maps:**
The react-map-gl package has export conflicts with Next.js 15. Here are solutions:

#### **Option 1: Alternative Map Library**
```bash
npm install leaflet react-leaflet
# Use OpenStreetMap (free) with similar features
```

#### **Option 2: Direct Mapbox GL JS**
```bash
npm install mapbox-gl
# Use Mapbox directly without react-map-gl wrapper
```

#### **Option 3: Downgrade Dependencies**
```bash
npm install react-map-gl@7.0.25
# Use older version with better Next.js compatibility
```
